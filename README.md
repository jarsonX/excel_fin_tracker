# Excel Finance Tracker

![dash_demo](https://github.com/jarsonX/excel_fin_tracker/blob/main/demo_dash.jpg)

**Description**
<br>This is a personal finance tracker created with Excel/VBA. It’s designed to help you track your personal finances and investments. All text is in Polish.

I’m sharing it to demonstrate my Excel/VBA skills. Please bear in mind that <span style="color:orange">VBA code works only when run on a local machine</span>. If you'd like to just inspect the code, I attached a file titled ['demo_code.txt'](https://github.com/jarsonX/excel_fin_tracker/blob/main/demo_code.txt). Otherwise, feel free to download the full version (file titled 'Finanse_...') and check how it works!

**How it works?** 
<br>It’s a simplified version of a tracker that I’m actually using to track my personal finances. I created it for two persons to include their incomes/balances on a monthly basis and calculate what amount to dedicate to what goal. There are currently no connections between Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet like the ones in real accounting. Although such functionality definitely can be implemented (and I'm a certified accountat, for God's sake!), this was not something I was aiming for.
