# Excel Finance Tracker

**Description**
This is a personal finance tracker created with Excel/VBA. It’s designed to help you track your personal finances and investments. All text is in Polish.

Please check the full file or demos that present how the dashboard looks and what code was used to make it work. I’m sharing it to demonstrate my Excel/VBA skills.

**How it works?** It’s a simplified version of a tracker that I’m actually using to track my personal finances. I created it for two persons to include their incomes and calculate what amount to dedicate to what goal.
