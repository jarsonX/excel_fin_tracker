# Excel Finance Tracker

![dash_demo](https://github.com/jarsonX/excel_fin_tracker/blob/main/demo_dash.jpg)

**Description**
<br>This is a personal finance tracker created with Excel/VBA. It’s designed to help you track your personal finances and investments. All text is in Polish.

I’m sharing it to demonstrate my Excel/VBA skills. Please bear in mind that VBA code works only when run on a local machine. If you'd like to just inspect the code, I attached a file titled ['demo_code.txt'](https://github.com/jarsonX/excel_fin_tracker/blob/main/demo_code.txt).

**How it works?** 
<br>It’s a simplified version of a tracker that I’m actually using to track my personal finances. I created it for two persons to include their incomes and calculate what amount to dedicate to what goal.
